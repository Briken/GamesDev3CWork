on the off chance that github does not include the DLLs or Model files, they can be found in the zip files in the same folder as the project file
they are labelled "dlls" and "ModelsAndAudio" respectively

"dlls" needs to be unzipped in the debug folder found in the same directory as it 
"ModelsAndAudio" needs to be unzipped in the "res" folder
